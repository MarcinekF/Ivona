## Overview üìÉ
This project is a simple window application that allows
to quickly convert text to speech.
It uses two models:
- **Eleven Multilingual V2** from **<a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">Eleven Labs</a>** API
- **XTTSv2** from **<a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS">Coqui TTS</a>** API repository

Both models are multilingual and can be used to convert text to speech in multiple languages.

## Installation üõ†
1. Clone the repository or download the zip file from latest <a href="https://github.com/mddzi77/Ivona/releases">release</a>.
2. Coqui TTS package requires installing <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/visual-cpp-build-tools/">Visual C++ Build Tools</a> to work properly.
3. Install the required packages using the following command in the project directory
(because of the size of the TTS package it might be necessary to install it manually `pip install TTS`)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the application by opening `main.py` file (first launch might take a while, because TTS package need to download the model).
You will be welcomed by the following window:
